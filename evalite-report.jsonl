Here are some of the fundamental types:\n\n1. **Number**: This type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. TypeScript uses the same number type as JavaScript, which is based on the IEEE 754 standard.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let age: number = 30;\n   let price: number = 19.99;\n   ```\n\n2. **String**: This type is used for textual data. Strings can be defined using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks for template literals.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let name: string = \"Alice\";\n   let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}`;\n   ```\n\n3. **Boolean**: This type represents a logical value that can be either true or false.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let isActive: boolean = true;\n   ```\n\n4. **Array**: TypeScript allows you to define arrays of a specific type. You can use either the array type syntax or the generic array type.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];\n   let fruits: Array<string> = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"];\n   ```\n\n5. **Tuple**: A tuple is a special type of array that allows you to define an array with fixed sizes and types for each element.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let person: [string, number] = [\"Bob\", 25];\n   ```\n\n6. **Enum**: Enums are a way to define a set of named constants. They can be numeric or string-based.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   enum Color {\n       Red,\n       Green,\n       Blue\n   }\n   let c: Color = Color.Green;\n   ```\n\n7. **Any**: The `any` type allows you to opt-out of type checking. It can hold any value, but using it can lead to less type safety.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let randomValue: any = 42;\n   randomValue = \"Now I'm a string\";\n   ```\n\n8. **Void**: This type is used for functions that do not return a value.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   function logMessage(message: string): void {\n       console.log(message);\n   }\n   ```\n\n9. **Null and Undefined**: These types represent the absence of a value. By default, `null` and `undefined` are subtypes of all other types.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let u: undefined = undefined;\n   let n: null = null;\n   ```\n\nUnderstanding these basic types is essential for leveraging TypeScript's capabilities to create type-safe applications.","scores":[{"name":"No Hashtags","score":1}],"duration":2,"score":1,"traces":[{"output":"TypeScript offers a variety of basic types that help developers create more robust and maintainable code.

Here are some of the fundamental types:\n\n1. **Number**: This type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. TypeScript uses the same number type as JavaScript, which is based on the IEEE 754 standard.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let age: number = 30;\n   let price: number = 19.99;\n   ```\n\n2. **String**: This type is used for textual data. Strings can be defined using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks for template literals.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let name: string = \"Alice\";\n   let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}`;\n   ```\n\n3. **Boolean**: This type represents a logical value that can be either true or false.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let isActive: boolean = true;\n   ```\n\n4. **Array**: TypeScript allows you to define arrays of a specific type. You can use either the array type syntax or the generic array type.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];\n   let fruits: Array<string> = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"];\n   ```\n\n5. **Tuple**: A tuple is a special type of array that allows you to define an array with fixed sizes and types for each element.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let person: [string, number] = [\"Bob\", 25];\n   ```\n\n6. **Enum**: Enums are a way to define a set of named constants. They can be numeric or string-based.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   enum Color {\n       Red,\n       Green,\n       Blue\n   }\n   let c: Color = Color.Green;\n   ```\n\n7. **Any**: The `any` type allows you to opt-out of type checking. It can hold any value, but using it can lead to less type safety.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let randomValue: any = 42;\n   randomValue = \"Now I'm a string\";\n   ```\n\n8. **Void**: This type is used for functions that do not return a value.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   function logMessage(message: string): void {\n       console.log(message);\n   }\n   ```\n\n9. **Null and Undefined**: These types represent the absence of a value. By default, `null` and `undefined` are subtypes of all other types.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let u: undefined = undefined;\n   let n: null = null;\n   ```\n\nUnderstanding these basic types is essential for leveraging TypeScript's capabilities to create type-safe applications.","scores":[{"name":"No Hashtags","score":1}],"duration":2,"score":1,"traces":[{"output":"TypeScript offers a variety of basic types that help developers create more robust and maintainable code.

Here are some of the fundamental types:\n\n1. **Number**: This type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. TypeScript uses the same number type as JavaScript, which is based on the IEEE 754 standard.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let age: number = 30;\n   let price: number = 19.99;\n   ```\n\n2. **String**: This type is used for textual data. Strings can be defined using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks for template literals.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let name: string = \"Alice\";\n   let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}`;\n   ```\n\n3. **Boolean**: This type represents a logical value that can be either true or false.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let isActive: boolean = true;\n   ```\n\n4. **Array**: TypeScript allows you to define arrays of a specific type. You can use either the array type syntax or the generic array type.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];\n   let fruits: Array<string> = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"];\n   ```\n\n5. **Tuple**: A tuple is a special type of array that allows you to define an array with fixed sizes and types for each element.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let person: [string, number] = [\"Bob\", 25];\n   ```\n\n6. **Enum**: Enums are a way to define a set of named constants. They can be numeric or string-based.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   enum Color {\n       Red,\n       Green,\n       Blue\n   }\n   let c: Color = Color.Green;\n   ```\n\n7. **Any**: The `any` type allows you to opt-out of type checking. It can hold any value, but using it can lead to less type safety.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let randomValue: any = 42;\n   randomValue = \"Now I'm a string\";\n   ```\n\n8. **Void**: This type is used for functions that do not return a value.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   function logMessage(message: string): void {\n       console.log(message);\n   }\n   ```\n\n9. **Null and Undefined**: These types represent the absence of a value. By default, `null` and `undefined` are subtypes of all other types.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let u: undefined = undefined;\n   let n: null = null;\n   ```\n\nUnderstanding these basic types is essential for leveraging TypeScript's capabilities to create type-safe applications.","scores":[{"name":"No Hashtags","score":1}],"duration":2,"score":1,"traces":[{"output":"TypeScript offers a variety of basic types that help developers create more robust and maintainable code.

Here are some of the fundamental types:\n\n1. **Number**: This type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. TypeScript uses the same number type as JavaScript, which is based on the IEEE 754 standard.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let age: number = 30;\n   let price: number = 19.99;\n   ```\n\n2. **String**: This type is used for textual data. Strings can be defined using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks for template literals.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let name: string = \"Alice\";\n   let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}`;\n   ```\n\n3. **Boolean**: This type represents a logical value that can be either true or false.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let isActive: boolean = true;\n   ```\n\n4. **Array**: TypeScript allows you to define arrays of a specific type. You can use either the array type syntax or the generic array type.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];\n   let fruits: Array<string> = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"];\n   ```\n\n5. **Tuple**: A tuple is a special type of array that allows you to define an array with fixed sizes and types for each element.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let person: [string, number] = [\"Bob\", 25];\n   ```\n\n6. **Enum**: Enums are a way to define a set of named constants. They can be numeric or string-based.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   enum Color {\n       Red,\n       Green,\n       Blue\n   }\n   let c: Color = Color.Green;\n   ```\n\n7. **Any**: The `any` type allows you to opt-out of type checking. It can hold any value, but using it can lead to less type safety.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let randomValue: any = 42;\n   randomValue = \"Now I'm a string\";\n   ```\n\n8. **Void**: This type is used for functions that do not return a value.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   function logMessage(message: string): void {\n       console.log(message);\n   }\n   ```\n\n9. **Null and Undefined**: These types represent the absence of a value. By default, `null` and `undefined` are subtypes of all other types.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let u: undefined = undefined;\n   let n: null = null;\n   ```\n\nUnderstanding these basic types is essential for leveraging TypeScript's capabilities to create type-safe applications.","scores":[{"name":"No Hashtags","score":1}],"duration":2,"score":1,"traces":[{"output":"TypeScript offers a variety of basic types that help developers create more robust and maintainable code.

Here are some of the fundamental types:\n\n1. **Number**: This type represents both integer and floating-point numbers. TypeScript uses the same number type as JavaScript, which is based on the IEEE 754 standard.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let age: number = 30;\n   let price: number = 19.99;\n   ```\n\n2. **String**: This type is used for textual data. Strings can be defined using single quotes, double quotes, or backticks for template literals.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let name: string = \"Alice\";\n   let greeting: string = `Hello, ${name}`;\n   ```\n\n3. **Boolean**: This type represents a logical value that can be either true or false.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let isActive: boolean = true;\n   ```\n\n4. **Array**: TypeScript allows you to define arrays of a specific type. You can use either the array type syntax or the generic array type.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];\n   let fruits: Array<string> = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"];\n   ```\n\n5. **Tuple**: A tuple is a special type of array that allows you to define an array with fixed sizes and types for each element.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let person: [string, number] = [\"Bob\", 25];\n   ```\n\n6. **Enum**: Enums are a way to define a set of named constants. They can be numeric or string-based.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   enum Color {\n       Red,\n       Green,\n       Blue\n   }\n   let c: Color = Color.Green;\n   ```\n\n7. **Any**: The `any` type allows you to opt-out of type checking. It can hold any value, but using it can lead to less type safety.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   let randomValue: any = 42;\n   randomValue = \"Now I'm a string\";\n   ```\n\n8. **Void**: This type is used for functions that do not return a value.\n\n   Example:\n   ```typescript\n   function logMessage(message: string): void {\n       console.log(message);\n   }\n   ```\n\n9. **Null and Undefined**: These types represent the absence of a value.
