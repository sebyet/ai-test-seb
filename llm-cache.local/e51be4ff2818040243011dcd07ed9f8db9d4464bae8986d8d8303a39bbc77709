{"text":"Model Assessment: XGBoost achieved 0.93 accuracy with precision of 0.94 and recall of 0.92. Training completed in 1.2 hours using 15,000 samples. F1-score of 0.93 indicates strong performance. The 95% CI of [0.91, 0.95] suggests high reliability in the model's predictions, reflecting consistent results across different subsets of data. Overall, the model demonstrates robust predictive capabilities, making it suitable for deployment in practical applications requiring high accuracy and reliability.","finishReason":"stop","usage":{"promptTokens":193,"completionTokens":111},"rawCall":{"rawPrompt":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a data science evaluation expert.
